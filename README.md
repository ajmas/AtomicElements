AtomicElements
==============

A small project to make the periodic table of elements available as format that
can be easily used in other projects. It should be used as a guide or starting point
and not as an absolute source.

The initial data originated from an older project, from around 2005.

If you need data that is going to be used where it matters, then you should cross-
reference with published scientific literature, such as those available from IUPAC, to
ensure correctness and up to date values

Contributions are welcome.

Disclaimer
----------

This project should not be used as part of anything where correctness is critical or
can make a difference. If you need data that is going to be used where it matters, then
you should cross-reference with published scientific literature, such as those availabl
from IUPAC, to ensure correctness and up to date values.

Files
-----

All files are tab delimited, and in UTF-8. 

The reason for the above file format, is that it makes it easier for people using
spreadsheets and databases. If you need the files in XML, JSON or another preferred
format, then I would recommend creating a script to do the appropriate conversion.

### elements.txt

Numeric data describing the elements.

### element_names_multilingual.txt

Element names in different languages, with each column heading using the appropriate ISO 2
language code. Data was originally from http://www.vanderkrogt.net/elements/
